Notes about amending changes.

It is important to stage added or modified files before amending, otherwise no changes will be made.

You can amend simply doing:
git commit amend -m "New commit message to rewrite last one"

Doing so you'll be avoiding a lot of commits fixing mistakes that were done.

Also, you can use amend command only to change the commit message if needed!
